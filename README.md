# Customer-Personality-Analysis


Introduction

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns of different types of customers. In this article, I’m going to introduce you to a data science project on customer personality analysis with Python.

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are revolutionizing the world through technical transformations. We can observe many machine learning applications in day-to-day lives, but one of the greatest applications of machine learning is to classify individuals based on their personality traits. Each person on this planet is unique and carries a unique personality. The availability of a high-dimensional and large amount of data has paved the way for increasing marketing campaigns' effectiveness by targeting specific people. Such personality-based communications are highly effective in increasing the popularity and attractiveness of products and services. It increased usage, customer satisfaction, and broader acceptance among users. Some common examples are: Personalization of online advertisement campaigns leads to more revenue and click-through rates.

Personality traits are closely associated with an individual’s behavior and preferences. Hence the fusion of a personality-based approach has primarily increased the Recommender System’s attractiveness.

Personality-based adaption’s are also used to provide personalized visualizations and could even suggest better music recommendations.

	Personality traits could also solve the “cold start” problem using scientifically validated and relatively stable latent dimensions of an individual based on personalized systems 	
With the availability of high-dimensional and fine-grained data about human behavior, it becomes too handy to research and observe human behavior. Using mobile sensing studies, data collected from our day-to-day activities have drastically altered how psychologists perform research and undertake personality assessments. Machine learning models are a boon to researchers and are used to learn highly complex relationships and evaluate their generalizability and robustness using the resampling method. It has the potential to transform research and assessment in personality psychology. Algorithms can handle vast datasets, including thousands of attributes, without succumbing to co-linearity issues. Moreover, ML algorithms are highly efficient in recognizing patterns in datasets that humans cannot even perceive. The use of these ML models can lead to better, more objective, and automated personality assessments.
People interact and express their likes, thoughts, feelings, and opinions on social media, capturing their personality traits. Machine Learning models have been actively using such a wide range of data to predict individuals. Various supervised machine learning algorithms like Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines are widely used among industries to predict personality traits. Moreover, recently, researchers have started to apply unsupervised learning methods to identify other psychological constructs in digital data. 



# Problem Statement

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
